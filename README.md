# DBBS
A project of database to organise the workflow and the partsflow at a bike shop.
Take into account the state of the bike, what needs to be done in terms of repair, what are the parts to order,
if the part is here, what is the priority of the order...

In addition, the pdf file show the tables relationship with the primary keys and foreign keys.

The codes work on postgresql 11/pgAdmin4.
